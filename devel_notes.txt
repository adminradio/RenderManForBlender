Notes - 
    Move to everything class based.  Around 
    Python New style classes.
    One Class per file
    Do ribgen through property groups (i.e object.renderman class rib gens object)
    Move to new IPR through viewport display
    check all code with pylint.  pep8 compliant!
    DOCUMENT CODE!!!

general structure

/RenderMan_for_Blender
    /resources - all the resource files
        /Args - Args files for osl shaders
            PxrLayerMixer.args
            PxrLayer.args
            PxrOsl.args
            PxrShadedSide.args
        /examples - put the benchmark scenes in here along with example renders. Also a script to render all the files and compare output test scenes if you will. Developers must test changes.
        /filters - light filter blend files
        /icons
        /preview - preview scene
        /shaders - osl

    __init__.py  - Load module and register classes with bpy.utils.register_module - don't individually register classes.  Also try to load generated plugin types

    /preferences

    /operators
       - Add more simple operators like "add renderman light" etc
        
    /ui 
        - one class/file per panel Only put panels here that spread over multiple property groups here, aka general panels

    /engine
        engine.py - use viewport display instead of IPR
        rpass.py - handles render setup/running and IPR updating
        spool.py - create alf files and spool
        server.py - display server 

    /properties - fully atomic property groups that correspond to the type they are mapped to.  Each property group should have a draw() and to_rib() method.  Also put corresponding panels in same file.  For example the object properties panel goes in object.py
        base_id.py - base for all id property groups.  this would define methods for rib gen of this property group
        object.py - rib gen for object 
        particle.py - particle system ribgen
        lamp.py
        material.py

        rman_plugin.py - base for all node types and plugins generated from args files
        RmanShader.py - Shader node type
        Sockets.py - socket types

    /util
