# icons.py

1. Icons are autogenerated now
2. IDs are built from filename (without path and extension)
3. IDs are converted to lowercase
4. only `*.png` (case sensitive) are processed

## Usage

```
from .icons.icons import get_iconid
iid = get_iconid("render")
row.operator(operator, text="Render", icon_value=iid)
```

## Advanced Usage (Toggle)

- create an icon for status ON, like `./icons/kelvin_on.png`
- create an icon for status OFF, like `./icons/kelvin_off.png`
- if not done before, import the utility function near the beginning of the file, like so:

    ```
    from .icons.icons import get_iconid
    ```

- in your code check a boolean condition and store in local var, i.e. `condition`
- get icon based on that condition


    ```
    condition = lamp_rm.PxrDomeLight_settings.temperature_enabled()
    iid = get_iconid("kelvin_on") if condition else ("kelvin_off")
    currentlayout.operator(operator, text='', icon_value=iid)
    ````

### Best Practice For **Toggles**

If you want a LED style icon, then you have to do this:

1. create a positive symbol (maybe color filled) but always with white border like this: ![Kelvin OFF](./kelvin_off.png)
2. create a negative symbol with a (meaningful) fillcolor, WITHOUT white borderlike: ![Kelvin OFF](./kelvin_on.png)

**Note:** The first symbol looks smaller because you can't see the white border on white background.
