# Documentation

This is the home of the PRMan for Blender addon for Renderman 21.x. The addon is a free way to try and learn how to use Pixar's RenderMan rendering software with the Blender animation solution. If you're just getting started, please take a look at the links below.

!!! Tip "Please note!"
    **RenderMan for Blender** _is developed by a small, dedicated group of professionals and weekend warriors working mostly in their spare time. Sometimes we move fast, sometimes not. As a result the documentation on new features may be incomplete, or missing entirely at first. We'll get it in eventually._
